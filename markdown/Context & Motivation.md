- Finding an exact solution to the electronic structure problem formally scales exponentially with the number of electrons.
- Gate-based quantum computation has the potential to overcome this by representing the electronic wavefunction using polynomially scaling quantum resources.
- we are only just now moving out of the NISQ era. that said, we have insufficient logical qubits, so these considerations are still relevant. see quantinuum - microsoft team up
- limited coherence times
- poor gate fidelity
- limited circuit depth

"Furthermore, experimental evidence shows that even relatively small parameterised quantum circuits can learn vastly complicated functions that would require a much larger classical neural network to learn" - p2 [[Diagrammatic Design & Study of Ansätze for QML - Richie Yeung]]

"Quantum computers are a natural tool of choice for simulating processes that are inherently quantum" - p3 [[Diagrammatic Design & Study of Ansätze for QML - Richie Yeung]]
