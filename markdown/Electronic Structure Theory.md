# 1) Exact and Inexact Wavefunctions

## Exact Conditions
### Condition 1
- The exact wavefunction is also an eigenfunction of any operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian

### Condition 2
- The local energy is a constant, equal to the eigenstate energy everywhere in space.
- Since this holds for points infinitesmally close to nodal surfaces, it therefore also holds at nodal surfaces

### Condition 3
- Condition 1 combined with the condition that the wavefunction must be finite-valued and continuous implies that any divergence in the Coulombic interaction must be exactly balanced by an equal and opposite divergence in kinetic energy
- The kinetic energy operator involves a second derivative with respect to electron position and diverges if there is a discontinuity in the first derivative

### Electron-Nucleus Coalescence
- Kato's cusp condition holds for all eigenstates $k$ and therefore for all admissable wavefunctions
