## Electronic Structure Problem
- The electronic structure problem refers to determining the ground electronic configuration and energy eigenvalues for a fixed set of nuclear coordinates (assuming non-relativistic)
- Note that the assumption of fixed nuclear coordinatesimplies the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
- The ground electronic state is therefore a parametric function of the nuclear coordinates
- The problem can be restated as finding the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for a given system
	- Term 1 - kinetic energy of each electron in system
	- Term 2 - potential interaction between each electron and each nucleus in the system
	- Term 3 - repulsive potential interaction between each pair of electrons in the system
	- Term 4 - constant repulsive potential between each nucleus in the system

### Geometry Optimisation
- A reasonable set of nuclear coordinates $R$ for a given molecule can be obtained from experimental data, empirical models, or a geometry optimisation
- A geometry optimisation minimises the lowest eigenvalue of the above Hamiltonian with respect to the nuclear positions to some local minimum
