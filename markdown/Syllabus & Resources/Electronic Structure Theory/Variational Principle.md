The variational principle states that for some Hamiltonian $\hat H$, the state (parametrised) state $\ket{\psi}$ that minimises the eigenvalue (energy) corresponds to the ground state. The state may be parametrised by a number of variables (nuclear positions, etc).

The Ritz principle essentially states that there exists some minimum on the multi-dimensional energy surface which corresponds to the ground state of the system.

The key insight here is that all physical information about the system is contained by the Hamiltonian, which tracks the physical interactions within the molecule.

Hence varying a set of parameters in our trial state does NOT correspond to changing the problem specification (which is inherent in the Hamiltonian), and thus no possible set of parameters can give an energy *below* the ground state.

The beauty of it all is that Nature finds this ground state by default.
