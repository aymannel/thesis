[Dynamical Pair Correlations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudUz0ErM7Y)

when we correlate the electrons, this is done by generating excitations out of the Slater determinant, and then taking weighted combinations of them. For example, configuration interaction mixes the ground state Slater determinant with singly, doubly, triply, etc excited determinants. A fancier way of doing this is coupled cluster, where cluster operators generate excitations out of the Slater determinant.

"The first thing one may imagine happening is that two particles mutually interact, thereby lifting themselves out of the Fermi sea, so that after the interaction both are in unoccupied orbitals"

The standard mathematical way to treat dynamic electron correlation is to "mix in" _excited_ Slater determinants, which is equivalent to saying that when two electron interact, they "excite" each other out of their ground state occupied orbitals and into previously unoccupied virtual orbitals. In other words, an excitation from occupied to unoccupied

**In other words the repulsive Coulombic correlation experienced between any two electrons results in the excitation of these electrons into higher energy virtual orbitals**
