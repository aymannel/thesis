#### Cannonical Quanitisation
The process of taking a classical Hamiltonian and using it to find its quantum analogue is known as canonical quantisation

#### Sparse Matrices
Sparse matrices provide efficient storage of double or logical data that has a large percentage of zeros. While full (or dense) matrices store every single element in memory regardless of value, sparse matrices store only the nonzero elements and their row indices.
