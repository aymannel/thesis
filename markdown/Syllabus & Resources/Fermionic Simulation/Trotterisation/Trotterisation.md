# Trotterisation
- efficient for local Hamiltonians that can be represented as a some of local terms
- the more commuting local terms in the sum, the more precise the simulation is
- 1st order formula is good for short time intervals
- long-time evolution can be simulated by repeating short intervals
- no ancilla qubits are required

- ZX could be useful here!
- We're talking about an approximation to account for the non-commutativity of the X and Z gates
- you might spot something graphically that you wouldn't have seen normally
