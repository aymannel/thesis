# ZX Calculus
## 1) Introduction
- make zx section comprehensive because this is the thing that people from chemistry are going to find interesting
- mathematically sound, complete and universal
- zx diagrams are "non-planar maps, a generalisation of directed graphs wherein the incident edges at each vertex are ordered, to admit non-commutative operations like the ∧X gate. Unlike operation lists or discrete time frames, this representation preserves only the connectivity of the operations, abstracting away qubit permutations and timing information." p2 [[Phase Gadget Synthesis for Shallow Circuits]]
- "ZX diagrams are invariant under spatial isotopy: if one diagram can be deformed into another, then they are equal." p7 [[Diagrammatic Design & Study of Ansätze for QML - Richie Yeung]]
- "The ZX calculus remains true under colour-swapping: by applying the Hadamard gate to all input and output legs, we see that the rules above are invariant under a Hadamard change of basis. The ZX calculus is also invariant under spatial isotopy: if two ZX diagrams can be deformed into one another, then they are equal." [[Diagrammatic Design & Study of Ansätze for QML - Richie Yeung]]
- "We have presented a sound but incomplete version of ZX calculus as it is easier to work with; a complete version is presented by Wang [15]"

### Notation
"Notation: In the following, we will mix freely the usual quantum circuit notation and the scalar-free zx-calculus [13]. For both forms of diagram, we will follow a left-to-right convention. We will also adopt the same convention for composition of circuits in equations, i.e. C;D means we apply C first, followed by D. A translation of common gates between the two formalisms is given in Figure 1. A brief introduction to the zx-calculus is found in [18]; for a complete treatment see [14]. For reasons of space we omit the zx-calculus inference rules, however we use the complete set of Vilmart [32]." [[Phase Gadget Synthesis for Shallow Circuits]]

"Here we have presented the rules for a scalar-free ZX calculus: since a quantum circuit must be unitary, working with a scalar-free ZX calculus allows us to preserve the circuit up to a global non-zero scalar, which does not alter the distribution of observed states." p8 [[Diagrammatic Design & Study of Ansätze for QML - Richie Yeung]]

"Unless specified, diagrams in this work are read from left to right, with the left wires as the input wires and the right wires as the output wires. Spiders with α = 0 have their phases omitted for brevity." p6 [[Diagrammatic Design & Study of Ansätze for QML - Richie Yeung]]
