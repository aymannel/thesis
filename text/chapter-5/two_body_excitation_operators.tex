\section{Two Body Excitation Operators}%
\label{two-body-excitation-operators}

A double fermionic excitation, from spin orbitals $p$ and $q$ to spin orbitals $r$ and $s$, can be expressed as $a^\dagger_r a^\dagger_s a_q a_p$ in second quantisation.

By taking a linear combination of the excitation and de-excitation operators acting on qubits $p$, $q$, $r$ and $s$, we obtain the following anti-Hermitian fermionic two-body excitation operator.
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{\kappa}_{pq}^{rs} = a^\dagger_r a^\dagger_s a_q a_p - a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_s a_r
\end{equation*}
Which after applying the Jordan-Wigner transformation can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices as follows.
\begin{align*}
    F_{pq}^{rs} = \frac{i}{8} (
      & X_p X_q Y_s X_r +
        Y_p X_q Y_s Y_r +
        X_p Y_q Y_s Y_r +
        X_p X_q X_s Y_r - \\
      & Y_p X_q X_s X_r -
        X_p Y_q X_s X_r -
        Y_p Y_q Y_s X_r -
        Y_p Y_q X_s Y_r )
    \prod_{k=p+1}^{q-1} Z_k
    \prod_{l=r+1}^{s-1} Z_l
\end{align*}
Multiplying by $\theta$ and exponentiating, we obtain the following unitary exponential two-body excitation operator, which we will refer to simply as a \textit{two-body excitation operator}.
\begin{equation*}
    U^{rs}_{pq} (\theta) = \text{exp} \left( i \frac{\theta}{8} (
    X_p X_q Y_s X_r
    + \dots -
    Y_p Y_q Y_s X_r -
    Y_p Y_q X_s Y_r )
    \prod_{k=p+1}^{q-1} Z_k
    \prod_{l=r+1}^{s-1} Z_l
    \right)
\end{equation*}

The full two-body excitation operator can be split into eight commuting exponential terms, implemented by eight Pauli gadgets. Taking $p=0$, $q=1$, $r=2$ and $s=3$ as an example, we obtain the following in Pauli gadget form.

\subsection{Two-Body Excitation Operators as Controlled Rotations}

Using the commutation relations derived in Chapter \ref{pauli-gadgets}, we can see that by conjugating the circuit with CNOT gates we obtain the following phase polynomial.

By cancelling adjacent change of basis gates, we can show that a two-body excitation operator corresponds to a triply-controlled rotation in the $Y$ basis (recalling the result for triply controlled rotations in Chapter \ref{controlled-rotations}), as in Yordanov \textit{et al}.
