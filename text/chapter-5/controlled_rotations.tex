\section{Excitations as Controlled Rotations}%
\label{operator-controlled-rotations}

We began this research with the goal of identifying a generalised structure for the excitation operators used in the DISCO-VQE algorithm, in the ZX calculus. We anticipated that by doing so, we might discover novel ways of optimising UCC ans√§tze by developing a representation for these excitation operators that is independent of specific architectural constraints, as well as identifying rules describing their interactions with one-another.

This led us to the work done by Yordanov \textit{et al} \cite{Yordanov2020} and Kornell \textit{et al} \cite{Kornell2023}, which show that it is possible to reveal an underlying controlled rotation within each excitation operator by conjugating it with some subcircuit $S$. Hence, in this chapter, we will replicate the results of Yordanov and Kornell in the ZX calculus using the results that we developed in previous chapters.

Since there exist several efficient implementations of controlled rotations, rewriting the UCC ansatz in terms of controlled rotations, then substituting with a more efficient implementation, we can drastically reduce the circuit depth.

We begin by demonstrating the result in Yordanov \textit{et al} by using a minimal one-body excitation operator, implemented by the following quantum circuit.

We can show that by inserting two adjacent $\text{CNOT}_{0, 1}$ gates (self-inverse) into the circuit and using the CNOT commutation rules derived in Chapter \ref{pauli-gadgets}, the one-body excitation operator can be expressed in terms of a singly-controlled $Y$ rotation.

Had we instead chosen to insert two $\text{CNOT}_{1, 0}$ gates, we would have obtained the following controlled rotation, with the control on qubit 1.

Let us now look at the general case, where the one-body excitation operator between qubits $p$ and $q$. We begin by eliminating the $Z$ legs responsible for calculating the parity of the fermionic state, then, by expressing the single-legged Pauli gadget as a single-qubit rotation in the $Y$ basis and fusing it with the adjacent Pauli gadget, we obtain the following controlled $Y$ rotation.

\newpage
Now let us consider the two-body excitation operator acting on qubits $p$, $q$, $r$ and $s$. By conjugating the circuit with three CNOT gates as well as two Pauli $X$ gates, we obtain the following.

Then, by cancelling adjacent Clifford gates, we obtain the a phase polynomial conjugated by Cliffords. Recognising this result as the triply-controlled rotation derived in Chapter \ref{controlled-rotations}, we have demonstrated the result in Yordanov \textit{et al}.
