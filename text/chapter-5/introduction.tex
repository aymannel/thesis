\chapter{ZxFermion Software}

ZxFermion is a Python package built on top of PyZX \cite{Kissinger2020} designed for the manipulation and visualisation of circuits of Pauli gadgets. With built-in Clifford tableau logic using Stim \cite{Gidney2021}, ZxFermion allows users to quickly implement proofs and test ideas.

VQE algorithms used in quantum chemistry often utilise the UCC framework in which excitation operators have a natural representation as Pauli gadgets. ZxFermion provides a comprehensive toolset designed to be used in a Jupyter notebook environment.
