\chapter{Excitation Operators}%
\label{excitation-operators}

In this chapter, we will use the theory that we have developed in Chapter \ref{pauli-gadgets} on Pauli gadgets and their commutation relations, and in Chapter \ref{controlled-rotations} on controlled rotations, to study the excitation operators used to construct Unitary-Product State ans√§tze.
