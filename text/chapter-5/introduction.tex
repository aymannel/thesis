\chapter{Excitation Operators}%
\label{excitation-operators}

In this chapter, we use the concepts discussed in the previous chapters to study one-body and paired two-body excitation operators using the ZX calculus. In Section \ref{implementing-excitation-operators}, we discuss the represention of the fermionic excitation operators in terms of Pauli gadgets as well as their specific circuit implementations. Then, in Section \ref{operator-commutations}, we discuss the several UPS ans√§tze generated by the DISCO-VQE algorithm, using the ZX calculus to attempt to rationalise their form. Finally, in Section \ref{operator-controlled-rotations}, we draw on the work done by Yordanov \textit{et al} \cite{Yordanov2020} and Kornell \textit{et al} \cite{Kornell2023}, to demonstrate how fermionic excitation operators can be expressed in terms of the controlled rotations discussed in Chapter \ref{controlled-rotations}.
