\chapter{Excitation Operators}%
\label{excitation-operators}

In this chapter, we will use the theory that we have developed in Chapter \ref{pauli-gadgets} on Pauli gadgets and their commutation relations, and in Chapter \ref{controlled-rotations} on controlled rotations, to study the excitation operators used to construct Unitary-Product State ans√§tze.


\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-5pt]
    \item introduce maths for both singles, doubles and paired first
    \item show example UCC ansatz in full
    \item describe as set of commuting Pauli gadgets. show commutation relations
    \item show commutation relations between different excitation operators
    \item introduce conjugation by some clifford to yield phase polynomial and suggest optimisation from \cite{Cowtan2020}
    \item introduce controlled rotation stuff in new section
\end{itemize}
