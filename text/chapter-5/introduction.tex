\chapter{Excitation Operators}%
\label{excitation-operators}

In this chapter, we will use the theory that we have developed in Chapter \ref{pauli-gadgets} on Pauli gadgets and their commutation relations, and in Chapter \ref{controlled-rotations} on controlled rotations, to study the excitation operators used to construct UCC ansätze.

    \item "Circuit optimisation is typically carried out by pattern replacement: recognising a subcircuit of specific form and replacing it with an equivalent" \cite{Cowtan2019}
    \item "In principle, local rewriting of gate sequences is sufficient for any circuit optimisation3. However, in practice, good results often require manipulation of large-scale structures in the quantum circuit. Phase gadgets are one such macroscopic structure that is easy to identify within circuits, easy to synthesise back into a circuit, and have a useful algebra of interactions with one another." \cite{Cowtan2019}
    \item "Further, in the balanced tree form more of the CX gates are “exposed” to the rest of the circuit, and could potentially be eliminated by a later optimisation pass" \cite{Cowtan2019}
\end{itemize}
