\section{Commuting Excitation Operators}%
\label{operator-commutations}

We define \textit{trivially commuting} excitation operators as operators that act on a disjoint set of qubits, and \textit{non-trivially commuting} excitation operators as operators which commute, yet act on the same qubits.

By expressing the excitation operators used to construct the UCC ansatz in the DISCO-VQE algorithm \cite{Burton2023}, and the Pauli gadget commutation rules developed in Section \ref{commutation-relations}, we were able to identify several non-trivial commuting pairs of excitation operators.
