\section{Excitation Operators as Pauli Gadgets}

Using the phase gadget result (\ref{phase-gadget-result}), we can show that the one-body excitation operator corresponds to two commuting Pauli gadgets.

One immediate advantage of representing the one-body excitation operator in this form is that we can easily show that these Pauli gadgets do indeed commute by recognising that they have two mismatching pairs of legs (\ref{commutation-relations}).

Another advantage is that it is immediately apparent that we can resynthesise the quantum circuit using the balanced tree decomposition result (\ref{balanced-tree}), yielding a circuit depth of $2\text{log}_2(n)$ rather than $2(n-1)$.

Similarly, we can show that the two-body excitation operator corresponds to eight Pauli gadgets, each of which can be shown to commute with every other gadget using the the rules described in Section \ref{commutation-relations}.

Using the balanced tree decomposition result (\ref{balanced-tree}), we can similarly reduce the circuit depth of the two-body excitation operator to $2\text{log}_2(n)$.
