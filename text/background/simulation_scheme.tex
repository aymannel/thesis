\section{Fermionic Simulation Scheme}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Map some fermionic state, usually in the occupation number representation to a qubit state.
    \item This mapping must be done in such a way as to preserve the fermionic anti-commutation relations, and hence preserve Pauli antisymmetry.
    \item Common fermionic-qubit mappings include Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev.
    \item We then act on the qubit state with a unitary operator that represents a fermionic operator.
    \item The resulting qubit state is then decoded to yield the resultant fermionic state.
    \item A successful simulation scheme is one that reproduces the action of the fermionic operator
\end{enumerate}
