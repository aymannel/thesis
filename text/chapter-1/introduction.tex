\label{background}

In this chapter, we will begin by discussing the context and motivation for the research conducted in this thesis, then develop the theoretical foundation required to simulate fermionic systems on quantum computers. We will start by giving an overview of Electronic Structure Theory in Section \ref{electronic-structure-theory}, then we will introduce the Fundamentals of Quantum Computation in Section \ref{quantum-computation} and finally, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm in Section \ref{vqe}.
