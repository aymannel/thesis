\label{background}

In this chapter, we begin by discussing the context and motivation for the research conducted in this thesis, then develop the theoretical foundation required to simulate fermionic systems on quantum computers. We start by giving an overview of Electronic Structure Theory in Section \ref{electronic-structure-theory}. We then introduce the fundamentals of quantum computation in Section \ref{quantum-computation}. Finally, we introduce the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in Section \ref{vqe}.
