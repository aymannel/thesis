Within the traditional coupled-cluster framework, the ground electronic state is prepared by applying the CC operator to a reference state (usually Hartree-Fock).
\begin{equation*}
    \ket\psi = e^{\hat T} \ket{\phi_0}
\end{equation*}

Where $\hat T$ is the cluster excitation operator.

Quantum gates, however, must be unitary operators, so instead, we work within the UCC framework.

\begin{equation*}
    \ket\psi = e^{\hat T} \ket{\phi_0}
\end{equation*}

Where $\hat T$ is now an \textbf{anti-Hermitian} operator, and $e^{\hat T}$ is unitary.

In general, we can prepare exact electronic states by applying a sequence of $k$ parametrised unitary operators to our reference state.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{gathered}
    \ket\psi = \prod_i^k U_i(\theta_i) \ket{\phi_0} \\
    \text{Where $U_i(\theta_i)$ is a parametrised unitary operator}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation*}\smallskip

The parameters $\theta_i$ are then optimised to find the ground state energy.

General fermionic single and double excitation operators are defined as,
\begin{equation*}
    a_q^\dagger a_p \text{ and } a_r^\dagger a_s^\dagger a_q a_p
\end{equation*}

Exciting one electron from $p$ to $q$, and two electrons from $p, q$ to $r, s$ respectively.

Taking a linear combination of these, we obtain \textbf{anti-Hermitian} fermionic single and double excitation operators.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{gathered}
    \hat\kappa_p^q = a_q^\dagger a_p - a_p^\dagger a_q \\
    %
    \hat\kappa_{pq}^{rs} =
    a_r^\dagger a_s^\dagger a_q a_p - a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r
\end{gathered}
\end{equation*}\smallskip

Such that upon exponentiating, we obtain \textbf{unitary} operators.

\begin{equation*}
    U^q_p = e^{\hat\kappa_p^q} \qquad
    %
    U_{pq}^{rs} = e^{\hat\kappa_{pq}^{rs}}
\end{equation*}
