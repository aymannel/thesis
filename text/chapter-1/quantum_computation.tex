\section{Fundamentals of Quantum Computating}%
\label{quantum-computation}

The central concept that enables gate-based quantum computation to represrent exponentially scaling fermionic states with polynomially scaling quantum resources is its ability to encode and manipulate superpositions of states. In this section, we provide an introduction to qubits and basic quantum gates.

\subsection{Introduction to Qubits}

Classical computation encodes information using binary strings formed from the computational basis states 0 and 1. Thus, given $n$ classical bits, we can encode $2^n$ binary strings. In contrast, information on a quantum computer is encoded using two quantum states, corresponding to vectors in a two-dimensional complex Hilert space $\mathbb{C}$. The $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$ states, known as the $Z$ computational basis, form the standard computational basis for encoding information on a quantum computer.

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{$Z$ computational basis states.}

\end{figure}

An arbitrary qubit state $\ket\psi$ can be described as a complex linear combination of the computational basis states, $\ket\psi = \alpha\ket 0 + \beta\ket 1$, provided that the qubit state is normalised. In other words we require two complex numbers, or four real numbers, to describe an arbitrary qubit state. Since only the relative phase between the basis states is directly measureable, there is a redundancy in this description that allows us to represent an arbitrary qubit state using only three real numbers.

By taking advantage of this redundancy, we can derive a three-dimensional representation of an arbitrary qubit state, known as the Bloch sphere. Note that opposite points on the Bloch sphere correspond to mutually orthonal states, as in Figure \ref{z-eigenstates} in which we have represented the $Z$ computational basis states.

We could have chosen to form our computational basis with any pair of orthonormal states. For instance, we define the $X$ basis states as follows.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includezxdiagramtext{chapter-1/plus}{0.4}{\,\,\,
        \frac{\ket 0 + \ket 1}{\sqrt 2}}
    \end{minipage}%
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includezxdiagramtext{chapter-1/minus}{0.4}{\,\,\,
        \frac{\ket 0 - \ket 1}{\sqrt 2}}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Computational $X$ basis states.}
    \label{x-eigenstates}
\end{figure}

In theory, a qubit can exist in an infinite number of states, however, upon measuring with respect to a particular basis, the qubit state collapses into one computational basis state, or the other. This result is known more formally as the \textit{no-cloning theorem}, which states that we cannot create indentical and independent copies of an arbitrary qubit state, as this would involve first measuring that state.

\subsection{Multiple-Qubit States}

Let us now consider systems consisting of multiple qubits. Similarly to how $n$ classical bits give rise to $2^n$ binary strings, we have that, $n$ qubits give rise to $2^n$ basis states. These basis states are formed by taking the Kronecker product. For instance, a two-qubit system gives rise to the four following basis states.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{equation*}
        \ket{00} = \ket 0 \otimes \ket 0 \qquad
        \ket{01} = \ket 0 \otimes \ket 1 \qquad
        \ket{10} = \ket 1 \otimes \ket 0 \qquad
        \ket{11} = \ket 1 \otimes \ket 1
    \end{equation*}
    \caption{The four basis states associated with a two-qubit system.}
    \label{two-qubit-states}
\end{figure}

An arbitrary $n$-qubit \textit{state vector}, describing the state of the entire system, can be formed by taking a complex linear combination of the $2^n$ basis states. Therefore, in order to fully describe an arbitrary $n$-qubit state vector, we need to specify $2^n$ complex coefficients. In the case of a two-qubit system, we have the following.
\begin{gather*}
    \ket\psi =
    \alpha \ket{00} +
    \beta \ket{01} +
    \gamma \ket{10} +
    \delta \ket{11} \\
    \text{where} \,\,\,\, \alpha, \, \beta, \, \gamma, \, \delta \in \mathbb{C}
\end{gather*}

\subsection{Introduction to Quantum Gates}%
\label{quantum-gates}

By definition, quantum gates correspond to unitary transformations, $U^{-1} = U^\dagger$ \cite{Nielsen2012}. In other words, any quantum gate corresponds to a square unitary matrix that conserves the complex inner product of the state it acts on. Consequently, quantum gates can be viewed as rotations of the qubit state vector in Hilbert space.

Let us now introduce the most fundamental quantum gates: the Pauli gates. The Pauli gates are described by the $2 \times 2$ Pauli matrices and rotate an arbitrary qubit state by $\pi$ radians about their respective axes.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{equation*}
        I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} \qquad
        X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix} \qquad
        Y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & \,\,\,\,0\end{pmatrix} \qquad
        Z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \,\,\,0 \\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    \caption{The Pauli matrices corresponding to the Pauli gates.}
    \label{pauli-matrices}
\end{figure}

The Pauli $X$ gate is the quantum analogue of the classical NOT gate in that it maps $\ket 0 \leftrightarrow \ket 1$. Importantly, the Pauli $X$ differs from its classical counterpart in that it can act on any arbitrary qubit state. Similarly, we have that the Pauli $Z$ gate maps $\ket + \leftrightarrow \ket -$, but can also act on any arbitrary qubit state.

The Hadamard gate is a member of the Clifford group that maps $\ket 0 \leftrightarrow \ket +$ and $\ket 1 \leftrightarrow \ket -$. Therefore, the Hadamard gate can be viewed as a rotation of the Bloch sphere $\pi$ radians about the line bisecting the $z$ and $x$ axes.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includezxdiagramtext{chapter-1/hadamard}{0.15}{
    \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}}
    \caption{Bloch sphere representation of the Hadamard gate.}
    \label{hadamard-definition}
\end{figure}

Since the Pauli gates and the Hadamard gate each correspond to unitary and Hermitian matrices, it follows that they are also self-inverse. Consequently, successively applying any of these gates is equivalent to applying the identity matrix $I$.

The R$_Z(\theta)$ and R$_X(\theta)$ rotation gates correspond to rotations of the Bloch sphere by some angle $\theta$ about the $Z$ and $X$ axes respectively.

              1 + e^{i\theta} & 1 - e^{i\theta} \\
              1 - e^{i\theta} & 1 + e^{i\theta}
        \end{pmatrix}}

\subsection{Multiple-Qubit Gates}

The CNOT gate is a two-qubit member of the Clifford group which we can use to entangle qubits. Consider a two-qubit state of the form $\ket \alpha \otimes \ket \beta$. Taking the first qubit ($\alpha$) to be the control, and the second qubit ($\beta$) to be the target, we define the CNOT gate as the gate that maps $\ket\alpha\otimes\ket\beta \rightarrow \ket\alpha\otimes\ket{\alpha\oplus\beta}$. That is, the CNOT gate applies the Pauli $X$ gate to the target qubit \textit{iff} the control qubit is in the $\ket 1$ state. The CNOT gate acts on the two-qubit basis states (\ref{two-qubit-states}) as follows.
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{00} \rightarrow \ket {00} \qquad
    \ket{01} \rightarrow \ket {01} \qquad
    \ket{10} \rightarrow \ket {11} \qquad
    \ket{11} \rightarrow \ket {10}
\end{equation*}
In this way the CNOT gate is the quantum generalisation of the classical XOR gate. We define the two matrices corresponding to the two CNOT gates, with the first qubit being the control and the second qubit being the target, and \textit{vice versa}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{equation*}
    \text{CNOT}^{c=0}_{t=1} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0
        \end{pmatrix} \qquad
        %
        \text{CNOT}^{c=1}_{t=0} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    \caption{Matrix definitions of the CNOT gate.}
    \label{cnot-definition}
\end{figure}

The CNOT gate can be used to entangle two qubits when the control qubit exists in a superposition of states. For instance, applying CNOT gate to the $\ket{+0}$ state, letting the first qubit be the control qubit ($\ket +$), yields the following Bell state.
\begin{equation*}
    \text{CNOT} \ket{+ \, 0} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt 2}
\end{equation*}
