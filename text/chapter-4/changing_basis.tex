\section{Changing Basis}

By conjugating the target qubit of the CR$_Z$ gate with Hadamard gates, we obtain a singly-controlled rotation in the $X$ basis. Or alternatively, by conjugating the target qubit by $X$ gates with phases $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ respectively, we obtain a singly-controlled rotation in the $Y$ basis.

We could also have chosen to conjugate the target qubits such that the rotations are controlled with respect to the $X$ or $Y$ bases, rather than the $Z$ basis.
