\section{Higher Order Controlled-Rotations}

We can implement higher order controlled rotations by nesting singly-controlled rotations in CNOT gates as in Yordanov \textit{et al} \cite{Yordanov2020}. For instance, we implement a doubly-controlled $Z$ rotation as follows.

By representing the singly-controlled $Z$ rotations in phase gadget form, we have the following.

By decomposing each singly-controlled rotation into quantum circuit notation, we get the following. By carefully choosing how we decompose the singly controlled rotations, we can cancel one pair of CNOT$_{1, 0}$ gates.

Using the commutation relations derived in Section \ref{commutation-relations}, we can express the doubly-controlled rotation as the following phase polynomial.
