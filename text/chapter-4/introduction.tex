\chapter{Controlled Rotations}%
\label{controlled-rotations}

In this chapter, we will show how controlled rotations, with $N$ controls, can be expressed as a phase polynomial consisting of $2^N$ phase gadgets. We will later use the results derived in this chapter to demonstrate the correspondence between excitation operators and controlled rotations in Chapter \ref{excitation-operators}.

In order to replicate the results of Yordanov \textit{et al} \cite{Yordanov2020}, we developed this representation of controlled rotations as phase polynomials after struggling to find related literature.
