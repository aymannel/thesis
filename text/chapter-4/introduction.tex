\chapter{Controlled Rotations}%
\label{controlled-rotations}

Controlled rotations play an important part in UCC ans√§tze representing fermionic systems. They can be used to account for the fermionic antisymmetry observed in fermionic systems by applying a phase (rotation) depending on the parity of the state. In other words, the rotation is \textit{controlled} by the parity of the state.

In this chapter, we will first discuss the form of singly-controlled rotations, as in Yeung \cite{Yeung2020}, and later show how these can be used to construct higher order controlled rotations, using the ZX calculus. We will later use the results derived in this chapter to demonstrate the correspondence between excitation operators and controlled rotations in Chapter \ref{excitation-operators}.
