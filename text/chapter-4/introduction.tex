\chapter{\label{commutation-relations}Commutation Relations}

In this chapter, we will develop a set of rules to describe the interaction of Pauli gadgets with other Pauli gadgets, CNOT gates and Clifford gates. We will refer to these rules as \textit{commutation relations}. Note, we are not referring to the quantum mechanical definition of commutation, but rather, what happens to two ZX diagrams when pushed through one another.
