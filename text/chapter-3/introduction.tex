\chapter{\label{variational-quantum-eigensolver}Variational Quantum Eigensolver}

In this chapter we introduce the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, a quantum algorithm first proposed in CITE that utilises the variational principle and unitary coupled cluster theory to variationally optimise fermionic wavefunctions on a quantum computer.
