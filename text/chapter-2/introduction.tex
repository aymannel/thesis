\chapter{\label{zx-calculus}ZX Calculus}

The ZX calculus is a diagrammatic language for reasoning about quantum processes LALALA

We will then introduce the rewrite rules... that come equipped with the ZX calculus. These rules extend the ZX calculus from notation into a language.

Notation
- flow of time goes from left to right
- global scalar factor


Note that in this text, we will interpret the flow of time from left to right.
Whilst we obtain the correct states, we obtain the wrong scalar factor. For the remainder of this thesis, we will ignore global non-zero scalar factors. Hence, equal signs should be interpreted as `equal up to a global phase'.

All the diagrams in this chapter also hold for the colour-swapped counterparts.
