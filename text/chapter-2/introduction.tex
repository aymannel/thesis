\chapter{ZX Calculus}%
\label{zx-calculus}

In this chapter, we will introduce the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for reasoning about quantum processes first introduced by Coecke \textit{et al} \cite{Coecke2011}. The ZX calculus can \textit{universally} represent any linear map, meaning any complex matrix of dimension $2^n \times 2^m$. In other words, any equation involving linear maps that is derivable in multilinear algebra can also be derived in the ZX calculus through its rewrite rules. Another important property of the ZX calculus is its \textit{soundness}, which means that the diagrammatic rewrite rules that make the ZX calculus a language, rather than just notation, preserve the underlying semantics of the linear map it represents \cite{Wetering2020}. We aim to use the ZX calculus to study UPS ans√§tze representing fermionic states, demonstrating its usefulness as an alternative perspective on the theory underlying the simulation of quantum systems.

This thesis uses the scalar-free ZX calculus. That is, the derivations in this thesis are correct up to some global non-zero scalar factor. All equal signs should, therefore, be interpreted as `equal up to a global phase'. This is done for convenience, in a similar way to how we sometimes work with unnormalised wavefunctions. Recalling that the matrix representing our quantum circuit $M$ is proportional to some unitary, $M^{-1} = M^\dagger$, we can later efficiently compute the scalar factor.
