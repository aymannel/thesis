\section{Clifford Conjugation}%
\label{clifford-conjugation}

The ZX calculus is a diagrammatic language that makes use of the complementary observables in the $Z$ and $X$ bases. Since both of these bases are Hermitian, we can arbitrarily deform their wires as we see fit. For instance, it is easy to show that the Pauli $Z$ gate ($Z$ spider with phase $\pi$) is Hermitian, $Z = Z^\dagger$, by finding its transpose (converting its inputs into outputs and \textit{vice verse}), then taking its complex conjugate (negating its phase $\pi \rightarrow -\pi = \pi$).

The $Y$ basis, unlike the $Z$ and $X$ bases, is \textit{not} Hermitian. Therefore, converting the inputs of a $Y$ \textit{Spider} into outputs and \textit{vice verse} does \textit{not} yield its transpose. We define rotations in the $Y$ basis with the following Clifford conjugations \cite{Yeung2020}.

The single-qubit Clifford gates, $R_Z \brac{\pi}{2}$, $R_Z \brac{3\pi}{2}$, $R_X \brac{\pi}{2}$ and $R_X \brac{\pi}{2}$, as defined in Grier \textit{et al} \cite{Grier2016}, are represented as follows in the ZX calculus.

Using the fact that the Clifford gates are unitary $C^{-1} = C^\dagger$, we expand our definition of the $Y$ rotation to obtain the following commutation relations \cite{Yeung2020}.
