\section{Summary}

identified non trivially commuting operators and proposed modification to disco algorithm

demonstrated yordanov and kornell

wrote zxfermion software


goals:
use the zx calculus to propose improvements to disco-vqe algorithm
- balanced tree represrentation
- account for commuting pairs of operators

\section{Future Work}

- diagonalisation of commuting pairs of operators
